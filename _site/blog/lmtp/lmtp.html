<h1>TLDR</h1>
<ul>
<li>Modified Treatment Policies are a collection of methods for <strong>defining</strong> and <strong>operationalizing</strong> interesting <strong>causal inference questions</strong>.</li>
<li>The unifying theme in this collection of methods is that they allow us to study hypothetical interventions, or treatment policies, that are <strong>extremely flexible</strong>.</li>
<li>This flexibility enables us to <strong>answer more realistic scientific questions</strong> in both <strong>cross-sectional and longitudinal settings</strong>, with <strong>multivariate, categorical, or continuous exposures</strong>.</li>

<p>Most modern causal inference methods utilize the <strong>potential outcomes framework</strong>, which asks questions of <strong>what would happen</strong> in a <strong>hypothetical world</strong> in which we could <strong>manipulate exposures</strong> and then <strong>compare outcomes for the same observations under different exposures</strong>.</p>
<p>Questions with binary exposures typically take the form, “<strong>what would happen if everyone had received the exposure compared to if no one had received the exposure</strong>?” Similarly, questions with multi-level or continuous exposures often take the form “what would happen if everyone had received <em>this much</em> of the exposure, versus if everyone had received <em>that much</em> of the exposure?” Study designs like this which compare all observations under two (or more) specific levels of exposure are called <strong>static interventions</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="static-interventions-are-a-common-approach-in-causal-inference-but-a-few-problems-frequently-arise." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="static-interventions-are-a-common-approach-in-causal-inference-but-a-few-problems-frequently-arise.">Static interventions are a common approach in causal inference, but a few problems frequently arise.</h2>
<h3 style="color: #C41E3A;" class="anchored">
<p>Problem #1: Positivity Violations</p>
</h3>
<p>A key requirement for causal inference is the <strong>positivity assumption</strong>. This means if you are comparing two exposures (say, treatments A vs.&nbsp;B), <strong>for every covariate combination</strong> in your dataset, there must be <strong>individuals who sometimes get treatment A and sometimes get treatment B</strong>. Intuitively, this ensures there is enough “experimentation” in the dataset that effects can be estimated.</p>




<a href="https://github.com/kathoffman/causal-inference-visual-guides/blob/master/comics/positivity_comic.jpeg"> <img src="positivity_comic.jpeg" style="float:right; padding-left:20px;" width="55%&quot;"> </a>


<p>As you can imagine, this often does not hold true. Sometimes there are <strong>theoretical positivity violations</strong>: for example, if we are studying the effects of a drug for heart disease, cardiologists might say this drug is never given to people who also have chronic kidney disease because the drug damages the kidneys. The probability of a patient receiving the drug conditional on having kidney disease will be zero in all datasets.</p>
<p>Other times we see <strong>practical positivity violations</strong>, meaning that due to small sample size and/or random chance, there are certain covariate combinations in which few observations receive the treatment of interest in our dataset. Perhaps in a dataset to study the previous example’s heart disease drug, due to random chance, there are no women aged 40-60 years who received the drug in the data. It is not a theoretical positivity violation (i.e.&nbsp;doctors would give the drug to women in this age group), but it is a practical violation nonetheless as it yields small or zero treatment probabilities.</p>
<p>Positivity issues must be addressed, preferably in the planning stage of a study.</p>
<h3 style="color: #C41E3A;" class="anchored">
<p>Problem #2: Unrealistic Interventions</p>
</h3>
<p>A second problem arises with static interventions: there are many situations in which it is <strong>not realistic to set everyone’s hypothetical exposure to the same value</strong>. Let’s take an example where we are studying the effect of physical activity. A static intervention approach might ask, “<em>what would happen if everyone exercised 30 minutes a week?</em>” Yet there is no actual intervention we could translate to the real world to make everyone exercise 30 minutes a week, i.e.&nbsp;there is no policy a decision-maker could enact to make this happen, even approximately. We could estimate an outcome under this policy, but this unrealistic intervention will likely have a meaningless result.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Notably, you can have an unrealistic intervention without having a positivity violation. For example, we may have access to a large data set with people of all possible covariate combinations who exercise 30 minutes a week; however, it is still scientifically not meaningful or realistic to evaluate a world in which everyone exercises the exact same amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<small>A graphical example of a static intervention on the pollution measurement of Air Quality Index (AQI).

<section id="one-possible-solution-to-the-problems-posed-by-static-interventions-is-dynamic-interventions." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-possible-solution-to-the-problems-posed-by-static-interventions-is-dynamic-interventions.">One possible solution to the problems posed by Static Interventions is Dynamic Interventions.</h2>
<p><strong>Dynamic treatment policies</strong> or interventions ask what would have happened in a hypothetical world where <strong>exposure is assigned based on each observation’s covariate history</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to study the effect of pollution on asthma attacks in the United States. A simple study design could be to find a representative sample of individuals living with asthma, measure their pollution exposure via the <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/">Air Quality Index (AQI)</a> on one calendar day (along with other confounders), and record whether an asthma attack occurs within a specified time frame.</p>
<p>Although I don’t study pollution, I know it is <strong>scientifically impossible</strong> for everyone in the US to receive the same air quality exposure, even in a world with countless environmental regulations. Natural and geographical forces such as wind, wildfires, elevation, proximity to the ocean, etc. make it <strong>unrealistic to study a single air quality exposure value for everyone</strong>.</p>
<p>We can try getting around these issues by evaluating a dynamic intervention that depends on baseline characteristics of the person or environment. For example, “<em>if a person lives in an urban area, make their AQI exposure 40, and if a person lives in a residential area, make their AQI exposure 20.</em>”</p>




<p><a href="https://github.com/kathoffman/causal-inference-visual-guides/blob/master/visual-guides/Types_of_Interventions.jpg"> <img src="lmtp/dynamic_graph.jpg" width="100%&quot;"> </a></p>
<figcaption>
<small>An example of a naturally observed exposure of AQI in the US (left) and what it would look like under a hypothetical dynamic intervention in which all urban counties have an AQI of 40 and rural counties have an AQI of 20 (right).</small>
</figcaption>


<p><br> This intervention may <strong>reduce positivity violations</strong> and <strong>lead to a more realistic study</strong>, yet there are <strong>many other interesting questions</strong> about air pollution <strong>we still cannot answer</strong> with dynamic treatment policies.</p>
<h3 style="color: #C41E3A;" class="anchored">
<p>Problem #3: Static and dynamic interventions cannot depend on the observed exposure</p>
</h3>
<p>Another <strong>key limitation</strong> with both static and dynamic interventions is that the <strong>hypothetical exposure value is completely determined by each observation’s baseline characteristics</strong> rather than the observed exposure. However, there are many <strong>interesting scientific questions</strong> about interventions that <strong>depend on the actual exposure received</strong>. For example, a more relevant question for our pollution example could be, “<em>what would have happened in a hypothetical world where everyone’s AQI exposure was 10% lower than what we observed?</em>” Or, “<em>what if the reduction had been 20 units for individuals living in an area with a daily AQI &gt; 100?</em>”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What questions, or hypothetical interventions, would we propose if we did not feel limited by statistical methodology?</p>

<section id="modified-treatment-policies-mtps" class="level1">
<h1>Modified Treatment Policies (MTPs)</h1>
<p>We can solve all three problems mentioned above with <strong>Modified Treatment Policies (MTPs)</strong>. MTPs describe <strong>hypothetical interventions which depend on the observed value of treatment</strong>, possibly in addition to baseline characteristics. We already mentioned two potential MTPs for our pollution example: “<em>what if we reduced everyone’s AQI exposure by 20%?</em>” and “<em>what if we reduced individuals living in an area with a daily AQI &gt; 100 by 20 units?</em>”</p>

<em>How would recovery rates change if we decreased surgery times for surgeries lasting longer than four hours?</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>How would diabetes incidence rates change if everyone with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;30 lowered their BMI by 2 units?</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>How would medical school admission rates change if all students with MCAT scores less than 500 increased their score by 5 points?</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MTPs are an excellent solution</strong> for getting around positivity issues to analyze <strong>more feasible and realistic interventions</strong>. Hopefully this list inspires you to think of MTPs relevant to your own field of study!</p>

<section id="a-general-and-unifying-framework-extending-to-longitudinal-settings" class="level1">
<h1>A general and unifying framework extending to longitudinal settings</h1>
<p>MTPs for cross-sectional, or point-treatment, studies have actually been <strong>generalized to exposures and covariates measured at multiple time points</strong>, i.e.&nbsp;longitudinal studies. We will refer to this generalization as <strong>Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies (LMTPs)</strong>, for which there is a corresponding <code>R</code> package called <code>lmtp</code>.</p>
<section id="longitudinal-data-analysis-complexities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="longitudinal-data-analysis-complexities">Longitudinal data analysis complexities</h2>
<p>Longitudinal studies pose certain crucial and often-overlooked issues, most notably time-dependent confounders. <strong>Time-dependent confounders are variables which change over time, affect the likelihood of both future exposure and the outcome, and are affected by previous exposure.</strong></p>
<p>A key time-dependent confounder for the relationship between pollution and asthma attacks could be weather. Hot, humid air causes air quality to decrease, and it also aggravates pulmonary conditions like asthma. I will explain time-dependent confounders more in later posts of this series, but for now, note that <strong>LMTP</strong> (the method and <code>R</code> package) <strong>properly accommodates time-dependent confounders.</strong></p>

<h1>Resources to learn more</h1>
<p>Future posts will walk through examples of applications like these using the <code>R</code> package <code>lmtp</code>. In the meantime, a recent summary of the literature is described in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1955691"><em>Nonparametric Causal Effects Based on Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies</em></a> by Díaz et al.&nbsp;Although the Díaz paper and accompanying <code>R</code> package are new, LMTP is an extension of causal inference concepts, methodology, and software that are well-established and steadily becoming more widely used.</p>
<p><strong>Here are several other resources I found useful in writing this post:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nick Williams’ (author of the <code>lmtp</code> package) <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-estimating-the-causal-effects-of-feasible-interventions-e07ed45136ff">blog post</a> introducing MTPs and using <code>lmtp</code> for an example with LSAT scores and law school admission rates.</li>
<li><a href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2021/03/ciwhatif_hernanrobins_30mar21.pdf"><em>What If</em></a> by Miguel Hernán and James Robins, a freely available book, has an entire section on longitudinal data and time-dependent confounding (see Part III, Chapters 19-21).</li>
<li><em>Effects of multiple interventions.</em> is a section in the book <em>Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors</em> by Robins et al.&nbsp;which brings up many of the issues which are later solved by MTPs.</li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23913589/"><em>Estimation of the effect of interventions that modify the received treatment</em></a> by Haneuse and Rotnitzky and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21977966/"><em>Population intervention causal effects based on stochastic interventions</em></a> by Diaz and van der Laan both describe the problem well, contain helpful examples, and make advances in the methodology for MTPs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/em-2012-0001/html?lang=en"><em>Identification, Estimation and Approximation of Risk under Interventions that Depend on the Natural Value of Treatment Using Observational Data</em></a> by Young et. al (2014) is a publicly available paper that also provides a good summary of the literature and fundamental progress to the methods of MTPs (in this paper they are “interventions which depend on the natural value of treatment”).</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all my posts, I welcome feedback from my intended audience and/or experts of causal inference. I am also open to suggestions of other resources to include in the reference section. Check back later for posts walking through specific examples and <code>R</code> code!</p>
