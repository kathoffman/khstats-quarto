My name is Katherine Hoffman, but I go by Kat (she/her).

I received my MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan in 2018, and I worked as a biostatistician in academic medical research in New York City from 2018-2023. In Fall 2023, I began the PhD program in Biostatistics at the University of Washington.

I am currently working with Dr. Marco Carone on flexible methodology for estimating shape-constrained dose response curves with time-to-event outcomes, with applications to correlates of protection for respiratory pathogens through a collaboration with Dr. Helen Chu.

Prior to studying biostatistics, I studied biochemistry and took pre-medicine courses at the University of Detroit Mercy. During the summers I cared for hospitalized patients as a nurse technician in Michigan and worked at a children's health clinic in rural Nicaragua. These experiences, combined with a love for mathematics, have made me passionate about improving the state of medical and public health research through education in statistics. 

I am particularly interested in statistical and epidemiological methods to estimate causal, rather than correlative, effects, and in methods which require as few assumptions on the underlying distribution of the data as possible. I especially enjoy thinking about how to study treatments or exposures which may vary over a study period.

I created this website in 2019 to store educational materials I've created on career, programming, and statistics topics. I am always open to hearing feedback on blog posts and illustrations, and I answer questions via email whenever I find time.
