Prior to studying biostatistics, I studied biochemistry and took pre-medicine courses at the University of Detroit Mercy. During the summers, I cared for hospitalized patients as a nurse technician in Michigan and worked at a children’s health clinic in rural Nicaragua. These experiences, combined with a love for mathematics, have made me passionate about improving the state of medical and public health research through education in statistics.

I received my MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan in 2018, and I worked as a biostatistician in academic medical research in New York City from 2018-2023. In Fall 2023, I began the PhD program in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. For the first two years, I took coursework in statistical theory, and I am currently working on my dissertation.

I am particularly interested in statistical and epidemiological methods to estimate causal, rather than correlative, effects, and in methods which require as few assumptions on the underlying distribution of the data as possible. I especially enjoy thinking about how to study treatments or exposures which may vary over a study period.

I created this website in 2019 to store educational materials I’ve created on career, programming, and statistics topics. I am always open to hearing feedback on blog posts and illustrations, and I answer questions via email whenever I find time.
