As with any data analysis, I need to examine the quality of my data before deciding which statistical methods to implement. \n\nThis post contains reproducible examples for how I prefer to visually explore survival data containing longitudinal exposures or covariates. I create a \"treatment timeline\" for each patient, and the end product looks something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trt-timelines_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n\n\nEach line represents one patient, and each square represents a measurement at a specified point. I find these graphs useful to look for patterns or discrepancies in follow up times, treatment, and missingness. They also allow me to verify that my coding is correct as I move through different data manipulations for my analyses.\n\nFor the following examples I generate longitudinal survival data sets. I skip over how I made this data because it's not the focus of this post, but if you have questions about the data generation please let me know. In general, I am trying to work from the point in a survival data analysis where you've already calculated each individual's time to event.\n\n# Example 1: Binary Treatment\n\nTo make these charts, my first step is to load the package `tidyverse`, since I use functions from `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `forcats`, and `ggplot2`.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n\nHere is the data generation code. If you're interested in how I made it, you can check the comments, but if not, **I recommend just copying and pasting into your `R` console to try the plotting code.**\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(7)\nn <- 50 # The data sets I make these visualizations for are typically 100-500 patients in size, but for space purposes I'll set my n to only 50.\ndat <- \n  tibble(.rows = n) %>%  # empty data frame / tibble with n rows\n  mutate(pt_id = factor(row_number()),  # patient ids are 1-n\n         pt_trt_prob = runif(n,0,1), # randomly generate a treatment probability for each patient so we can see patterns\n         months_followup = round(runif(n, 0, 20)), # randomly generate length of time in the study\n         death = rbinom(n, 1, .5)) %>% # death randomly occurs at any time point. Obviously an unrealistic assumption. :)\n  group_by(pt_id) %>%   # group by patient so we can do more data manipulation\n  complete(months_followup = full_seq(0:max(months_followup), 1)) %>% # add i^n all the months patients are in the study\n  fill(pt_trt_prob, .direction = \"up\") %>% # fill in the treatment probability I made earlier so I can use this to add treatment for every time point\n  ungroup() %>% # no longer need patients grouped\n  mutate(trt = factor(rbinom(row_number(), 1, pt_trt_prob^2)),  # fill in treatment for everyone based on their treatment probability\n         death = replace_na(death, 0)) %>%  # also fill in death\n  select(pt_id, months_followup, trt, death) # remove leftover columns from data generation\n```\n\n\nLet's look at the data. It's in \"long\" format with patient ID's repeating for each `month_followup` they were in my (fake) study. At every month, we know whether or not they were on the treatment, and whether they died at that time point. This first example does not contain any missingness.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::kable(head(dat))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|pt_id | months_followup|trt | death|\n|:-----|---------------:|:---|-----:|\n|1     |               0|1   |     0|\n|1     |               1|1   |     0|\n|1     |               2|1   |     0|\n|1     |               3|1   |     0|\n|1     |               4|1   |     0|\n|1     |               5|1   |     0|\n:::\n\n\nWe can now plot our data in a very basic way. We really only need to specify in the `aes`thetics that the `x`-axis is time, the `y`-axis is subject IDs, the `col`or should correspond to treatment, and *our lines should be `group`ed together by subject*. Don't forget that last one! Then we can say we want `geom_line` to make a base timeline for each subject, and the points on the timeline should be squares (`shape = 15` in the `geom_point` mapping function).\n\nEt voilÃ ! A cute patient treatment timeline.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = months_followup, y = pt_id, group = pt_id, col = trt)) +\n  geom_line()  + \n  geom_point(shape = 15)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trt-timelines_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n\nOkay, it's not *that* cute. But that little bit of code is really the core of the plot! If you want to add markers of death (or any other event) and rearrange by length of follow up time it just takes a little bit of extra data manipulation and one additional line of `ggplot2` code.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat %>%\n  group_by(pt_id) %>%\n  # make a new column with all patients last follow up visit\n  mutate(last_month_followup = max(months_followup), \n         # new variable for month that patients died, if they died\n         month_death = case_when(death == 1 ~ last_month_followup, TRUE ~ NA_real_)) %>%\n         # reorder pt id by last month of follow up (highest to lowest)\n         # without fct_rev, chart is arranged in opposite direction (lowest to highest)\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(pt_id = fct_rev(fct_reorder(pt_id, last_month_followup))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = months_followup, y = pt_id, group = pt_id, col = trt)) +\n  geom_line()  + \n  geom_point(shape = 15) + \n  # add in a new mapping layer of points that correspond to death\n  geom_point(aes(x = month_death, y = pt_id), col = \"black\", shape = 4) \n```\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 515 rows containing missing values (geom_point).\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trt-timelines_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n\nDon't worry about the warning for removing missing values -- it's because we have `NA`s at most months for our `month_death`, so `geom_point` doesn't know where to put an 'x' marker.\n\nFinally, let's work on making the plot a bit nicer to look at:\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat %>%\n  group_by(pt_id) %>%\n  mutate(last_month_followup = max(months_followup), \n         month_death = case_when(death == 1 ~ last_month_followup, TRUE ~ NA_real_)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(pt_id = fct_rev(fct_reorder(pt_id, last_month_followup)),\n         # make the treatment variable labels nicer\n         trt = factor(trt, levels=0:1, labels=c(\"No\",\"Yes\"))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = months_followup, y = pt_id, group = pt_id, col = trt)) +\n  geom_line()  + \n  geom_point(shape = 15) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = month_death, y = pt_id), col = \"black\", shape = 4) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Months of Follow-Up\", y = \"Patient ID\", col = \"Treatment\",\n       title = \"Patient Treatment Timeline\",\n       subtitle = \"x indicates month of patient death\") +\n  # edit legend box and make patient ids small\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=6),\n        legend.position = c(.6, .9), legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n        legend.background = element_rect(linetype=\"solid\", colour =\"black\")) +\n  # remove extra space around timeline\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0.01,0.01)) +\n  # set the color of the lines and points\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"dodgerblue\",\"firebrick1\"))\n```\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 515 rows containing missing values (geom_point).\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trt-timelines_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n\nI have never made one of these plots for publication, so I don't mind that the subtitle contains legend information. If you wanted to have the `month_death` markers in a legend, you could change: \n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngeom_point(aes(x = month_death, y = pt_id), col = \"black\", shape = 4)\n```\n\nto:\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngeom_point(aes(x = month_death, y = pt_id, shape = month_death), col = \"black\")\n```\n\n\n# Example 2: Continuous Covariate with Missingness\n\nWe can follow the very same steps for making a timeline for a continuous variable.\n\nAgain, here is the data generation code so you can make these plots yourself:\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat_cc <- \n  tibble(.rows = n) %>%\n  mutate(pt_id = row_number(),\n         months_followup = round(runif(n, 0, 12)), # random months of follow up\n         pt_cov_mean = runif(n, 80, 150), # random mean of a patient's covariate measures\n         death = rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)) %>% # random death\n  group_by(pt_id) %>%\n  complete(months_followup = full_seq(0:max(months_followup), 1)) %>%\n  fill(pt_cov_mean, death, .direction = \"up\") %>%\n  mutate(last_month_followup = max(months_followup),\n         death_date = case_when(death == 1 ~ last_month_followup, TRUE ~ NA_real_)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(cov = rnorm(row_number(), pt_cov_mean, 10))  # everyone's covariates are close to their original mean (use to see patterns later)\n```\n\n\nThis time I am incorporating missingness at a patient-level on my simulated covariate measurements to show how we can use the plots to look at potential patterns in missingness.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat_cc_samp <- dat_cc %>%\n  mutate(idx = row_number()) %>%\n  sample_frac(.4, weight = pt_cov_mean^3)  %>% # sample 40% of data, with weights for the sample determined by the patient's mean covariate.
