# khstats-quarto

Personal website Quarto source code. Hosted by Netlify.

### Helpful documentation:

- https://quarto.org/docs/websites/
- https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html

### Folder directory

The website layout is controlled by `_quarto.yml` and `styles.css`. The home page is described by `index.qmd`. Other `.qmd` files are self explanatory.

- `art` contains visualization pages
- `pubs` contains research works
- `csl` contains citation style language for publication referencing
- `blogs` contains all blog posts within subdirectories
- `talks` contains slide decks
- `static` contains CV and other static docs
- `img` contains images (this is a disorganized directory from my old blogdown site which I may someday clean up)
