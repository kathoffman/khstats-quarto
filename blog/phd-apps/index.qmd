> A minor life update – **I applied to Biostatistics PhD programs last fall!** And, a major life update– **I’m moving to Seattle to attend the University of Washington (UW)’s program next month**. I’m super excited (and nervous) to begin. Since applications are opening up for next year, I thought I’d write a quick post about what the process of deciding to apply, actually applying, and deciding on a program was like for me.

# Background and FAQs

I was in a somewhat uncommon situation when I applied in Fall 2022 for Fall 2023 matriculation; I’d already received my MS in Biostatistics in 2018 and had been working in academic medical research since. Because of this, I had many academic biostatistician colleagues and friends to consult about my application. Since not everyone has this opportunity, I thought I’d pass on what was told to me, especially the advice I was given on writing my statement of purpose (SOP). **I found the SOP advice so helpful that I’ve publicly shared mine in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ex3nUpPqc8CCWTnMKeyRUDnUF_C9GOriJBtY-47eASg/edit?usp=sharing)**, and added pieces of advice I received in the comments.

I am by no means an expert at what biostatistics graduate programs are looking for, and this is not a comprehensive post on applying to (biostatistics) graduate school. For more thorough and general information, I recommend Lucy Lai’s post on [applying to graduate programs](https://lucy-lai.com/blog/gradapps) and Simon Couch’s post on [applying to statistics and biostatistics graduate programs](https://www.simonpcouch.com/blog/apply-to-stats-grad-school/#fnref:8). Nonetheless, I hope some of you might find my experience useful, or you might be able to pass it on to a future applicant who will find it useful!

### Do you need a PhD to be successful in biostatistics?

A question I’m frequently asked from students and earlier-in-their-career biostatisticians lately is if I feel a PhD is necessary because of a “ceiling” in biostatistics. My answer was and still is: a PhD is absolutely *not* necessary. In fact, for a while, I was extremely resistant to the idea of pursuing one. It’s a huge financial and personal commitment, and it’s worth carefully examining whether it’s the right decision for you, now or ever.

I wholeheartedly believe I could have been fulfilled (intellectually, financially) in Masters-level statistician/data science jobs forever. There are many interesting roles in both industry and academic research. Some are heavily programming related, some are much more statistics-heavy, and other roles would mean career progression via supervision/management of other biostatisticians and programmers. A (bio)statistics degree is extremely versatile because you can pivot to areas such as data engineering, software writing, data reporting/querying/interpreting, and more. There have been multiple times over the past five years that I’ve seriously considered trying out data journalism and/or more serious data visualization.

However, I *really* love studying and teaching causal inference and statistics. Beginning around Spring 2022, I had a nagging feeling that it might be the right time in my life to deeply learn many concepts I’ve struggled to learn for years without formal coursework and training. I wanted to learn these concepts not because I particularly want to develop new methods as an academic researcher, or to make lots of money in industry, but rather because I see huge gaps in the statistical and epidemiological methods which are available and what are actually being used in applied research. I know I will feel fulfilled the rest of my career if I can work on improving these gaps, either through education, scientific communication, or mentorship.

### Should you take time off before your PhD?

The other question I'm often asked is whether it was intentional to take “so much time” off and/or whether I’m glad I waited to go back for my PhD. This is somewhat difficult to answer before I start the program (it might be really hard to go back to school, I have no idea!), but at the moment, I am extremely happy I took five years off between finishing the MS and starting the PhD. I had plenty of time to narrow and pursue my interests without any pressure and while making good money. I also had time to learn work-life balance, which I wasn't great at until a few years ago. I was able to build up my application through an abundance of research and teaching opportunities, and I believe this allowed me to be a far more competitive applicant than I would’ve been out of my MS. Finally, I learned a lot about myself! I feel so much more emotionally mature and resilient than I was five years ago.

# The Application Process

<!-- In this post, I’ll be honest about my experience, including what schools I applied to and where I did/did not get in. I hope none of the information I give deters anyone from applying to any schools because you have a different background than me. I’ve been working as a full-time biostatistician since I finished my MS in Biostatistics 5 years ago, so I necessarily have a different background than someone applying from undergrad or a masters degree. However, PhD programs accept many, many students with less work/research experience than me (and with stronger backgrounds in other ways). I am by no means an expert in applying or in understanding what the application committees look for; I can only report what worked (and hypothesize about what didn’t work!) for me. -->

In this post, I’ll try to be as honest as possible about my personal experience in applying. I hope none of the information I provide deters anyone from applying to any schools because you have a different background than me. I’ve been working full-time for five years, so I necessarily have a different background than someone applying from an undergraduate or Masters degree. However, PhD programs accept many, many students with less work/research experience than me (and with stronger backgrounds in other ways), so my successes and failures should not be considered predictive of someone else's.

## Assessing which schools to apply to

I gauged my competitiveness for applying to PhD programs by asking biostatistics faculty I knew from working in the field and/or who taught me during my MS. I also searched Reddit for relevant content ([r/biostatistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/biostatistics/)) and used [Gradcafe](https://forum.thegradcafe.com/topic/141530-fall-2023-statisticsbiostatistics-applicants-thread/). (Be wary of anonymous sources on the internet, though!)

From these sources, I gathered that my strengths were:

- having a MS in Biostatistics already
- five years of full-time work as a biostatistical consultant
- experience as the lead data analyst/statistician on many applied projects (with publications)
- leading some of my own research papers (with publications)
- participating in statistical methodology research (with publications)

I decided my main weakness would be my lack of mathematics background. Even though I had good grades in my Biostatistics MS program, I had only the minimum math requirements to apply (Calc I-III and linear algebra), and my Calc III and linear algebra grades were mediocre, albeit from 10 years ago.

Of note, when I read posts on GradCafe, the general consensus was that U.S. citizens (which I am) have a higher chance of being admitted to programs in the U.S. I don’t have much insight on this, but I think it has to do with funding opportunities. There are many government sponsored funding opportunities which are unfortunately only available to domestic students. 

In the end, I applied to eight schools: two schools in New York City (where I currently live) and six other schools which are consistently considered to be top programs for biostatistics. I knew I wouldn’t be willing to leave NYC and my current job for most programs, so I only selected schools I could actually see myself considering.

## Application organization

I kept track of all my applications and notes on a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) page. I made several tables with information about each school’s requirements and created to-do lists for various tasks (e.g. sending transcripts). I also wrote out my letter of recommendation (LOR) writers’ names, emails, and titles so that I would have an easier time copying and pasting.

## Application Components

### Letters of Recommendation

For LORs, I asked:

1. My long-time mentor who I’ve worked with for 4 years and who could speak to my research potential for both methods and applied work. He is mid-career and well-known within the field of causal inference statistical estimation methods.
2. A long-time physician collaborator who I’d also worked with on applied projects for 4 years who could talk about my skill set in applied projects.
3. My current boss, an epidemiologist who at the time I’d only worked with for a few months, but who seemed comfortable writing about my scientific potential.
4. (Extra letter) My former professor in an applied capstone course during my MS who could speak to my discipline and aptitude for completing coursework.

I think this is general LOR advice, but I only asked individuals who I was pretty sure would write strong letters on my behalf. I tried to find a balance in people who were respected/known in the field and people who worked with me enough to write about me. Remember to ask your letter-writers early, as well as register early with the schools’ application systems so the writers have plenty of time to upload their letters.

### GRE Scores

My GRE scores expired a few years back, but thankfully all the schools I applied to haven’t required them since the pandemic, so I didn’t retake the test. Of note, a few schools said they required them on their website, but did not actually when I inquired with admissions. For one school I only had to self-report my old scores.

### Gathering/filling out transcripts

All the schools I applied to required me to manually enter all relevant (science, math, statistics, etc.) coursework into their own application system. You generally have to enter the course name, number, number of credits, semester you took it, and your corresponding grade in the course. This is super time consuming, and I recommend beginning to work on this as soon as applications open. Many of the application portals were glitchy, and this would have been hard to complete at the last minute.

### The Statement of Purpose (SOP)

By far the hardest part of the application for me! There’s a lot of opinions surrounding the statement of purpose for Biostatistics PhDs, from, “it’s extremely important and the only way to set yourself apart to the application committee,” to, “nobody reads it and it won’t affect your application.” I opted to believe the first set of opinions, and took my SOP seriously.

I received a lot of advice on my statement. The most helpful piece of advice I received was that the SOP is not about highlighting qualifications – that’s what the CV does – and qualifications alone does not equate to success in academia. You need drive and motivation, and your SOP is the chance to show that you have it. It is more about your philosophy and research goals than stating what you've done so far. Every time you bring up an accomplishment, you should explain to the committee exactly why that’s relevant to your overall message of wanting to pursue a PhD in biostatistics. If something is not directly relevant to why you want to pursue a PhD or why you’ll be successful, you should not be including it.

I ended up receiving so much advice for this, that I decided to publicly post my UW SOP on a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ex3nUpPqc8CCWTnMKeyRUDnUF_C9GOriJBtY-47eASg/edit?usp=sharing) with comments. Some other resources I found helpful include these [California State Example Essays](https://www.csuci.edu/careerdevelopment/services/sample-graduate-school-admissions-essays.pdf) and [Lucy Lai's Personal Statement for her Neuroscience PhD applications](https://lucy-lai.com/blog/gradapps). These tweet threads were also useful:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Writing a statement of purpose (SOP) for PhD admissions – please do not make me read another “as a kid, when I looked at the sky…” <br><br>a thread.</p>&mdash; Hadas Kress-Gazit (@HadasKressGazit) <a href="https://twitter.com/HadasKressGazit/status/1460261854912073733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every year I read a lot of grad school applications from accomplished people that don&#39;t give me the info I&#39;m looking for. It feels like a major hidden curriculum thing.

If you take only one thing away from my SOP advice: **start writing your SOP early and ask at least one person who has served on an academic application committee, preferably for Biostatistics PhDs, to read your draft to make sure you're on the right track**. This is the easiest part of your application to control!

### The Personal Statement

Only a few schools required this, and the prompts were related to why your background uniquely adds to your scientific potential. This statement is, of course, very personal to your own background! I wrote about how growing up in a rural Midwest town with my entire family in blue-collar jobs shaped my understanding of public health and access to education. I also wrote about my work and volunteer experience in low income areas and with underrepresented groups, and my motivations for improving diversity in the field as driven by my experiences as an underrepresented gender in STEM. This will obviously look very different for any given applicant. I am not posting my personal statement publicly, but if you have a reason you think it’d be helpful to see my personal statement, please email me.

## Pre Application Review Service (PARS)

I sent all my application materials in November to UW’s [Pre Application Review Service (PARS)](https://stat.uw.edu/pre-application-review-service) for review by current students. This is an excellent service available to underrepresented genders and minority groups. Not only was I able to get feedback on my application, but I made connections with a statistics PhD student who reviewed my application and a biostatistics PhD student who he subsequently introduced me to via email.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our department is offering a pre-application review service (PARS) initiative to provide support and mentorship to PhD applicants from historically marginalized groups.

# Interviews and visit days

Applications were due December 1, and I began hearing about interviews the first week of December. My first interview was mid-December (a virtual half-day). The first in-person interview was in mid-January. My last interview was late February (virtual) and in-person visit days for admitted students continued through early April. All in-person visits except for one school were fully funded. I did not attend the unfunded visit day.

I found the interviews stressful to plan around (e.g. I had to cancel at least one pre-planned vacation) but the interviews themselves to be easy (caveat: I’ve done many interviews and interviewed several biostatistician job candidates over the years, so it felt fairly routine). The questions I was asked were generally along the lines of:

- Tell me about why you want to do a PhD. Why do you think you need it? What are you hoping to accomplish during your PhD?
- Why [this school]? Why [city the school is located in]?
- Tell me about a time when you had to collaborate with others to get a project done.
- What questions do you have about our program or [location of the school]?

For many of these questions, I reiterated (sometimes verbatim) sentences from my statement of purpose. I also brought up random research projects I’d done over the years, depending on where the conversation went. The people interviewing you are just trying to assess your fit with the program and gauge your excitement. I know it is easier said than done, but my takeaway from the interviews was that it was best to just let the conversation flow. The interviews were usually 30 minutes long, so make sure you have lots of questions prepared for when the interviewer flips the question-asking to you. If you run out of questions about the program, start asking the interviewer about their research or what their favorite things to do are around the university.

Despite the interview questions feeling straightforward to me, the days were EXHAUSTING, both physically and mentally. You essentially have 8am-9pm day(s) with other applicants, students, and faculty, and you have to be “on” the entire day. This experience can be really overwhelming, so go easy on yourself. I recommend writing notes down after each interview day/visit – I kept a long running note on my phone.

# Decision time

Of the eight schools I applied to, I was accepted to five. My acceptances and rejections didn’t make a ton of sense to me either way, meaning I was surprised to receive certain acceptances while also receiving rejections from schools I thought I had a higher chance of getting into. This supported a phrase I heard a lot, “PhD admissions are a bit of a black box.”  There are many qualified applicants, especially to the top programs, and it is hard to discern between applicants by a CV, transcript, and statement of purpose. Different application committee members will have biases in what they’re looking for (e.g. strong mathematics background vs. research experience) and it’s best not to dwell too much on any particular outcome.

It was a difficult decision for me to choose between programs. I was extremely torn about the idea of leaving the community I have in NYC. However, I could not shake the feeling that my visit at UW had felt overwhelmingly “right." After a lot of pro-con lists, I decided to go with this gut feeling.

The major choices which affected my decision were location, overall fit of the program/coursework, current students’ relationships within and between cohorts, perceived work-life balance of students and faculty, funding/research requirements, teaching requirements, and number of faculty working on what I wanted to work on (non-parametric causal inference). After I finished my visit days, I set up follow-up meetings with professors and the graduate program directors from multiple schools to make sure I understood my options correctly. I made my decision to attend UW at the end of March, about two weeks before the April 15th decision deadline.

# Looking ahead, preparing for my PhD coursework

UW is on the quarter system, so I'll start classes at the end of September. This summer I’ve been working, enjoying life sans homework, and trying to remember all the math I’ve forgotten over the years.

I’m refreshing myself on linear algebra using a combination of Khan Academy (I love Sal’s visualizations – I listen on 1.5-2x speed and slow down when he says something that I don’t understand) and [*Linear Algebra Done Right*](https://www.chegg.com/textbooks/linear-algebra-done-right-3rd-edition-9783319110790-3319110799?preSelection=rent&c_id=sem&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=tb--long_tail-campaign_googleshoppingpmax&utm_content=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoeemBhCfARIsADR2QCtzOvpwHTwWyhhjZ551Ez8HeQc2iH94LOR1OS9wunkhrt5PU_-9Ux8aAvhrEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) by Sheldon Axler. The latter is a small textbook which is meant to be a second learning of linear algebra (it’s quite abstract compared to the usual sequence of teaching the subject). This [Github repo](https://github.com/jubnoske08/linear_algebra) with solutions to Axler’s exercises is also helpful. I am also brushing up calculus using a mix of Khan Academy, random Youtube videos, and the textbook [*Advanced Calculus*](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/advanced-calculus_patrick-m-fitzpatrick/623425/item/12685126/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=low_vol_f%2fm%2fs_standard_shopping_customer_aquisition&utm_adgroup=&utm_term=&utm_content=603452145786&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoeemBhCfARIsADR2QCvVNjDm6ZZA30SMj00ghtI6qbOycK_PZMa21bwDg2PdtNeVVe-cfCUaAsGDEALw_wcB#idiq=12685126&edition=7979483) by Patrick M. Fitzpatrick. This is what I wish I would've done before starting my MS degree. :)

If you'd like to know more about what my work looked like as an applied biostatistician in medical research, please see my [Day in the Life of a Biostatistician](https://www.khstats.com/blog/ditl/) post. I answer common email questions stemming from that post in this [Follow-up post](https://www.khstats.com/blog/ditl/ditl-followup). As always, feel free to email me with questions, clarifications, or suggestions for additional resources.

Until next time!
