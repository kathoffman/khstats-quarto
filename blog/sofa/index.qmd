The **Serial Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)** is a measure used in hospitals to define and assign **severity of illness** in acutely ill patients. The score measures general dysfunction in **six vital organ systems**: the lung, brain, heart, liver, kidney, and blood. Each of these organs receive an **integer subscore, ranging from 0 to 4**, using routinely collected labs and vital signs. The **sum of the six subscores, ranging from 0 to 24, creates a patient's SOFA score**. The higher a patient's SOFA score, the sicker they are. There are plenty of [online calculators](https://www.mdcalc.com/sequential-organ-failure-assessment-sofa-score) for SOFA scores that you can check out you're curious about exactly what goes into each of the subscores.

SOFA scores are useful as a quick live-check for physicians of a patient's overall well-being, but they're moreso used extensively in critical care observational research. We use SOFA scores to adjust for severity of illness as a confounder in observational studies, and they're often used as inclusion criteria for deciding which patients are eligible for therapies in a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). There are plenty of pros and cons of SOFA, but one aspect of SOFA scores that is perhaps non-intuitive for many physicians is just how many ways there are for a patient with a drastically different clinical profile to have the same SOFA score as another patient.

Recently a pulmonologist who I work closely with, [Dr. Edward Schenck](https://twitter.com/edschenck), sent me an email with the subject line "Help!!" I clicked on his email, and found an interesting question:

> ***There is only one way for a patient to have a SOFA score of 0 (all six subscores are 0). There are six ways a patient could have a SOFA score of 6 (one of the six subscores is 1). But how many ways are there for a patient to get a SOFA score of 10?***

It was a serious question from him, but a beautiful mid-day brainteaser break for me. What *are* the number of possible combinations to get every possible SOFA score, from 0 to 24?

<!-- I’ll solve this problem first using R code, then combinatorics, and finally I’ll talk about the implications this has in acute care research, including randomized clinical trials for acute-care therapies (COVID-19 included!) which use SOFA scores as an inclusion criteria. -->

We can solve this problem with only a few lines of code in `R` by using `expand.grid()` to make all the combinations of the 6 scores, which can take values `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`.

```{r}
combos <- expand.grid("lung" = 0:4, "liver" = 0:4, "heart" = 0:4, "blood" = 0:4, "brain" = 0:4, "kidney" = 0:4)
head(combos,n=20)
combos$total_sofa <- rowSums(combos)
head(combos,n=20)
sofa_counts <- table(combos$total_sofa)
sofa_counts
```

We can plot those numbers using `ggplot2`:

```{r, warning=F,message=F}
library(tidyverse)

combos %>%
  count(total_sofa) %>%
  ggplot(aes(total_sofa, n, label=formatC(n, format="d", big.mark=","))) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=total_sofa, xend=total_sofa, y=0, yend=n)) +
  geom_text(nudge_y = 60) +
  labs(x="Total SOFA Score", y="Number of Combinations") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0), limits=c(-20,2000), labels=scales::comma_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:24) +
  guides(fill=F) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="navy",high="firebrick2") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
         plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,
                                  face = "bold", size = 20),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=12, face="bold", vjust=2.5)
        ) +
  labs(title="Number of subscore combinations per SOFA score") + 
  annotate("segment", x = 6, xend = 9, y = 1800, yend = 1600, colour = "dodgerblue2", size=2, arrow=arrow())
```

<!-- ## Solving with Combinatorics  -->

<!-- This problem is akin to rolling a five-sided dice six times and then summing the numbers. We can determine the probability of getting each total. This Wolfram Alpha article walks through the proof. -->
